 \section{Theory}
 \begin{itemize}

  \item  In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous signal to a discrete signal. 
  \item A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal). 
  \item A sample refers to a value or set of values at a point in time and/or space. A sampler is a subsystem or operation that extracts samples from a continuous signal. A theoretical ideal sampler produces samples equivalent to the instantaneous value of the continuous signal at the desired points. 
  \item Nyquist Sampling theorem is of great importance in sampling the signals. It states that a signal can be completely determined from its samples if they are taken at uniform intervals each of length (less than or equal to) 1/2B where B is the bandwidth of the signal.
